# re-simple-python-project

This simple project structure template repository is adapted from the [Good Enough Project](https://github.com/bvreede/good-enough-project) Cookiecutter template by Barbara Vreede (2019).
If you plan to develop a package, check the [template repository for a Python package](https://github.com/UtrechtUniversity/re-python-package).

## Usage

Click "Use this template" at the top of this page to create a new repository with the same folder structure.

## Project Structure

The project structure distinguishes three kinds of folders:
- read-only (RO): not edited by either code or researcher
- human-writeable (HW): edited by the researcher only.
- project-generated (PG): folders generated when running the code; these folders can be deleted or emptied and will be completely reconstituted as the project is run.
